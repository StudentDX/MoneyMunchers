      With PepperMint, we bring to you the right tools to manage your personal finances.
      Some people use Excel, some use a paper and pen, and some use personal accounting software--
      but most of us just don’t know what to do. Our financial lives are complicated-- cash, cards, savings, debt--
      and we’re not all born gifted accountants.
      <br>
      So we-- the MoneyMunchers-- embarked on a mission to solve our collective problem with our minimum yet powerful skills.
      And thus PepperMint was born-- a simple, seamless, and intuitive tool to manage your personal finances. We want to give you
      real "control" over your money; what comes in, what goes out, what you have saved, what you have budgeted. We want to give
      you the tools to understand where your money goes, and empower you to set and achieve financial goals.
